Background. Please read the following articles for background. You should be able to get through the first seven links in one sitting.

Note that Coursera policy forbids us from putting direct pdfs of copyrighted articles online without explicit permission - even for educational purposes - so try Googling the title and then clicking through if you hit a paywall. We may be able to acquire all relevant permissions by the second iteration of the class.
